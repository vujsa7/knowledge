# What does NoSQL mean?
--- 
Some people say that NoSQL means '*not only SQL*' and other say that it means '*not SQL*'. In reality it's just a marketing term that was used to attract people to NoSQL dbs. Many different databases fall into this category: 
- [[Document DBs]]
- [[Graph DBs]]
- Key-Value pair DBs
- Column DBs
- Realtime DBs
- Time series DBs

> NoSQL dbs are just a group of databases that are non-relational databases.
